# Stockfolio
A small yet complete Vue.js/Firebase app I created when I first learned Vue.js. Inspired by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Stock Trader, improved with additional features.

## Stack:
- Client: Vue.js, MaterializeCSS, Axios
- Server: Firebase DB
- Tools: Vue CLI 3

## To do:
- Replace Materialize CSS with Vuetify
- Finish mobile version
