# Stockfolio
A small yet complete Vue.js/Firebase app I created when I first learned Vue.js and was trying to explore the framework's vast ecosystem. Inspired by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Stock Trader, improved with additional features.

## Stack:
- Client: Vue.js, Vuetify, Axios, Material Design Icons
- Server: Firebase DB
- Tools: Vue CLI 3
- Store: Vuex
- Router: Vue Router

## To do:
- Fix filters in portfolio page (not displayed on first page load)
- Add authentication
- Improve back-end middleware
